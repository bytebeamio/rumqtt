## [rumqttc 0.24.0] - 27-02-2024

### Added
- Expose `EventLoop::clean` to allow triggering shutdown and subsequent storage of pending requests
- Support for all variants of TLS key formats currently supported by Rustls: `PKCS#1`, `PKCS#8`, `RFC5915`. In practice we should now support all RSA keys and ECC keys in `DER` and `SEC1` encoding. Previously only `PKCS#1` and `PKCS#8` where supported.
- TLS Error variants: `NoValidClientCertInChain`, `NoValidKeyInChain`.
- Drain `Request`s, which weren't received by eventloop, from channel and put them in pending while doing cleanup to prevent data loss.
- websocket request modifier for v4 client
- Surfaced `AsyncClient`'s `from_senders` method to the `Client` as `from_sender`

### Changed
- `MqttOptions::new` now accepts empty client id.
- `MqttOptions::set_clean_session` now panics if client ID is empty and `clean_session` flag is set to false.
- Synchronous client methods take `&self` instead of `&mut self` (#646)
- Removed the `Key` enum: users do not need to specify the TLS key variant in the `TlsConfiguration` anymore, this is inferred automatically.
To update your code simply remove `Key::ECC()` or `Key::RSA()` from the initialization.
- certificate for client authentication is now optional while using native-tls. `der` & `password` fields are replaced by `client_auth`.
- Make v5 `RetainForwardRule` public, in order to allow setting it when constructing `Filter` values.
- Use `VecDeque` instead of `IntoIter` to fix unintentional drop of pending requests on `EventLoop::clean` (#780)
- `StateError::IncommingPacketTooLarge` is now `StateError::IncomingPacketTooLarge`.
- Update `tokio-rustls` to `0.25.0`, `rustls-native-certs` to `0.7.0`, `rustls-webpki` to `0.102.1`,
  `rusttls-pemfile` to `2.0.0`, `async-tungstenite` to `0.24.0`, `ws_stream_tungstenite` to `0.12.0`
  and `http` to `1.0.0`. This is a breaking change as types from some of these crates are part of
  the public API.
- `publish` / `subscribe` / `unsubscribe` methods on `AsyncClient` and `Client` now return a `PkidPromise` which resolves into the identifier value chosen by the `EventLoop` when handling the packet. 

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed
- Lowered the MSRV to 1.64.0
- Request modifier function should be Send and Sync and removed unnecessary Box

- Verify "mqtt" is present in websocket subprotocol header.

### Security

    - Added `proxy` feature gate
    - Refactored `eventloop::network_connect` to allow setting proxy

### Security

## [rumqttc 0.21.0] - 01-05-2023

### Added

### Security


## [rumqttc 0.20.0] - 17-01-2023

### Added

### Changed

- `ConnectionError` now has specific variant for type of `Timeout`, `FlushTimeout` and `NetworkTimeout` instead of generic `Timeout` for both (#545)
- `conn_timeout` is moved into `NetworkOptions` (#545)
